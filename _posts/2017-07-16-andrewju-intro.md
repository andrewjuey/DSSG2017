I am an incoming graduate student at UC Berkeley’s School of Information. For the last three and a half years, I’ve worked for the City and County of San Francisco, first as a City Hall Fellow at the City Performance Unit doing policy operations consulting, and then as a founding member of and forecasting analyst at CleanPowerSF. Prior to my time in the San Francisco Bay Area, I conducted research on South Korea’s renewable and nuclear energy industries on a Fulbright grant at Seoul National University’s Graduate School of Environmental Studies. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, with my undergraduate degree in International Political Economy and Business from the University of Southern California. 

I’m excited to spend the summer here at the eScience Institute and with DSSG working on the ORCA project. My goals are to improve my programming skills, particularly in Python as I’ve been primarily a R programmer, and to get more experience in applying machine learning techniques on messy, real-world datasets (the ORCA data looks like it’ll provide plenty of experience). I look forward to developing my data science skillset and hopefully deriving positive actionable insights on public transit with the results of the ORCA project.
